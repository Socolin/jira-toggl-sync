jira-toggl-sync (ALPHA)
=======================

A simple tool to synchronize Toggl time entries into Atlassian JIRA's work log entries

Open a command line in the tool directory and type:

> jira-toggl-sync

The tool will prompt for a Toggl API key (which can be found in your profile page at the bottom), and for a JIRA instance URL, username and password.

The tool will then exit, as nothing else was implemented yet!
